Copy the contents below and paste into your live map.  

To toggle the HUD on/off, use any *Spray*.  
To change the hotkey, look in the *conditions* section of the rule named *HUD*.  
There will be a disabled condition that you can modify. Be sure to enable that condition and disable the *Spray* condition above it.
